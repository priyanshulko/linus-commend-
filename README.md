# linus-command-
The provided Bash script defines a custom command-line utility called internsctl for various intern operations. Here's an explanation of the code:

Version Definition:

The script begins by defining a version number (VERSION="v0.1.0").
Manual Page Function (display_manual):

This function uses a here document (cat <<EOF ... EOF) to display the manual page for internsctl.
It includes information such as the command's name, synopsis, description, available options, examples, author, and version.
Help Information Function (display_help):

This function provides a concise overview of the command and its available options.
It outlines usage patterns and specific commands, including subcommands for CPU, memory, user, and file operations.
Get File Information Functions (get_file_info and get_specific_file_info):

get_file_info retrieves general information about a specified file, such as size, permissions, owner, and last modification time.
get_specific_file_info is designed for more specific file information based on options like size, permissions, owner, or last modified time.
Main Script Logic:

The main script logic is organized using a case statement, interpreting the first command-line argument ($1).
If the first argument is --help, it invokes display_help.
If it's --version, it prints the version number.
For subcommands like cpu, memory, user, and file, it further interprets the next argument to execute specific logic.
Subcommand Logic:

For cpu and memory, placeholder comments indicate where logic for retrieving CPU and memory information would be added.
For user, it handles subcommands like create and list with additional logic placeholders.
For file, it distinguishes between general file information and specific file information based on options.
Error Handling:

The script includes error-handling mechanisms, such as checking if a file exists before attempting to retrieve information.
It provides meaningful error messages for unknown commands or missing file names.
Execution:

The script concludes with an exit statement ('exit 0') to indicate successful execution.
